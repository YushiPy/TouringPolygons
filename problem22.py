Implementation of the second variation of the problem. 

We are given:
- A starting point `s`.
- A target point `t`.
- Convex polygons P_1, ..., P_k.
- Simple poligons called "fences" F_0, ..., F_k such that
for all 0 <= i <= k the polygons P_i and P_{i + 1} are inside the fence F_i.
We will conside that P_0 = s and P_{k + 1} = t.

We will also consider that:
- The polygons are non intersecting
- The problem is in 2D.
