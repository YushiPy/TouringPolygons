# TSPN: maintained B&B versus Fekete SOCP B&B

Times include only completed solver calls; process-censored runs have no solution time. Native time-limit runs report elapsed solver time but do not imply gap closure. See config.json for matched formulation, gap, tolerances and strict Gurobi settings.

| Class | Band | Instance | k | Ours ms / calls / closed | Fekete ms / calls / closed | Valid O/F | Timeouts O/F | Objective spread | Interval separation | Matched speedup |
|---|---:|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|
| OSM | 25-40 | large_osm_25-40_sao_paulo_n040_seed7537 | 39 | 2002.245 / 299 / 0 | 2010.012 / 2406 / 0 | 3 / 3 | 0 / 0 | 35.034896579648716 | 0 | None |

Per-class and size-band aggregates are in strata.json. Speedups require all repetitions of both backends to pass validation and close the matched gap. Calls are B&B relaxations. Gap-closed counts are separate from feasible-tour counts. Bounds from Fekete are numerical, not exact certificates. A time-limited solve can return a feasible tour without closing the requested gap; a process timeout is censored and has no solution time.
