# TouringPolygons

Repository for implementations of the problem of touring polygons

## Problem Statement

Given a starting point $A$ and end point $B$, along with a sequence of polygons $P_1, P_2, \ldots, P_n$, find the shortest path from $A$ to $B$ that visits each polygon at least once. The polygons must be traversed in the order they are given, the path may also cross itself and the polygons.

### Variations

We will consider several variations of the problem, including:

- Polygons are convex or non-convex.
- There is an encompassing polygon that must not be crossed.
- The polygons may intersect.
- The problem is in a higher dimension (e.g., 3D polygons).
